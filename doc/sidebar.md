# Sidebar functionality

The website has a sidebar that is shown by default on both desktop and mobile devices. When the user clicks on the hamburger icon (â˜°) that is shown in the top left corner, the sidebar toggles its visibility. 

The text in the sidebar is padded to the left to make it look like a menu.

The sidebar is implemented using the Bootstrap framework and the navbar component. The sidebar is visible by default on desktop devices and hidden on mobile devices. The sidebar is collapsed when the user clicks on the hamburger icon. Clicking again on the hamburger icon toggles the sidebar visibility.
